ShiftLoL is a window mover/resizer for League of Legends. This application is a replacement for ShiftWindow and aimed at LoL streamers.

ShiftLoL will find the League of Legends window and strecth it to the monitor screen.
If your League of Legends window is on the second monitor then ShiftLoL will stretch it to the second monitor.

ShiftLoL has a built-in timer so you won't have to trigger the tool everytime you open the game.

You can close the application, enable/disable the timer, or manually shift the window by right clicking to the tray icon in the taskbar and clicking to the corresponding menu item.

Optionally you can put a "hit.wav" file in the application folder, so you will hear that sound instead of a beep sound when window gets resized/moved. File must be encoded in WAV format.

Requirements:
* You must have .Net Framework 4 installed.
* In game settings, you must set resolution to AxB(e.g. 1440x900) and disable fullscreen mode.
* You also must set resolution to AxB from system settings.
